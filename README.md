#MineSweeper on FPGA with VGA

It's My First github Project

I only include the source files and the coe files.
For each coe file, you need to create an IP core, block memory, ROM?? something like that, I'll check it later.

And my board is Spartan6 N3, if your board is different, you need to change the .ucf file (in "code"). And I'm not sure that it can run on your board...

##To be improved
If the maps can be randomized, the better!
And, I'm almost running out the recourses on the board.
